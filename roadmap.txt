"Flavour Generator" Roadmap
Product name candidates:
Paprika

TODO:

1.Identifiers in [referenced text] so that differing instances can be generated
Currently [animal] is generated once, and all occurences of [animal] replaced with, say, 'dog'.
Solution: Allow #comments inside [blocks]
[animal#1] - stops parsing at # but still calculates the closing bound (for replacement)
[animal#2] - gets the same category, but isn't caught in the replacement of [animal#1]

2.Import files
