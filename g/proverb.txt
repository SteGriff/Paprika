*proverb first half
Sticks and stones will break my bones
Laugh and the world laughs with you, 
If you fail to plan, 
Hope for the best, but
If you're not part of the solution, 
When in Rome, 
Live by the sword, 
Jack of all trades and 
The truth shall set you free... 
Walk the walk and 
Where there's a will,
Some days you get the bear,
It it ain't broke 
When the cat is away, 
Two is company,
